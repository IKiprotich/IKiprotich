# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Ian**, a product-minded developer based in **Kenya**, building simple, useful apps as a **freelance** and **indie iOS dev**.

I care about creating apps that make a real difference, meaningful tools that improve everyday life, especially in underrepresented markets. From clean UI to reliable backends, I love turning raw ideas into polished products, and I'm always learning how to build better.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me lifting, running, hiking, or writing, always moving, always reflecting.
